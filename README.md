# OpenCV-ObjectDetection
This project is a real-time object detection system built using OpenCV and ONNX Runtime. It detects and highlights objects captured through a webcam or external camera feed. The system supports both YOLOv5 (ONNX format) and MobileNet-SSD (Caffe model) simultaneously, making it robust and flexible for various applications.

âœ… Features:
Real-time object detection using webcam.

Dual-model support: YOLOv5 (ONNX) and MobileNet-SSD (Caffe).

Region of Interest (ROI) box to restrict detection to a specific area.

Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.

Customizable for different object categories (e.g., pen, book, keyboard, airpods).

Easy integration into desktop applications using Java + OpenCV.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Java (Backend logic)

OpenCV (Image processing)

ONNX Runtime (Model inference)

Pre-trained models (YOLOv5s, MobileNet-SSD)

ðŸ“¦ Use Cases:
Smart surveillance systems

Product recognition on conveyor belts

Hand gesture or object-based control interfaces

Inventory tracking in warehouses
