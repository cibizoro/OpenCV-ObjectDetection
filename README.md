# OpenCV-ObjectDetection
This project is a real-time object detection system built using OpenCV and ONNX Runtime. It detects and highlights objects captured through a webcam or external camera feed. The system supports both YOLOv5 (ONNX format) and MobileNet-SSD (Caffe model) simultaneously, making it robust and flexible for various applications.
